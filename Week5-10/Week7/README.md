### Damn Vulnerable DeFi - Truster
The flashloan contract allows us to call any target, with the calldata that we want. As we know that the contract owns a lot of tokens, we will call the approve function from the flashloan contract. Doing this, we can approve our attacker wallet to control the contract's token. Then the attacker just needs to use transferFrom.
