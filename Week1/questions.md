## What is the design motivation behind EIP-777 and EIP-1363 ?
First, those EIP are both backward compatible with ERC-20.

The motivation is to offer holders more control over their tokens. With ERC-20, when a contract or an address receive a token, there is no way to execute code after a transfer or approval.

As code will be executed, recipient can deny reception by using revert.



## What are the pros and cons of both tokens ?

|   | ERC-777 | ERC-1363 |
